            {input:The structure and delivery of this semester's Programming Fundamentals module has significantly hindered student learning. 
            The lecture materials frequently contained outdated code examples that didn't align with current industry practices, and practical sessions were often 
            cancelled with less than an hour's notice. The disconnect between lecture content and assignment requirements has left many students struggling 
            to complete coursework, with several having to seek external resources to understand basic concepts. The lack of clear documentation for the assignment 
            specifications and inconsistent grading criteria have created unnecessary confusion. To ensure student success, we need comprehensive lecture notes, 
            reliable practical sessions, and clear assessment guidelines that align with the module's learning objectives. }{output: Desire, Curiousity,}
